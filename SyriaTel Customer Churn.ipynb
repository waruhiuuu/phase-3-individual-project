Customer churn is one of the most important concerns for large companies. Customer churn is a metric showing when a subscriber or a regular customer cancels his subscription or stops doing business with a company. Churn could be due to various factors, including switching to a competitor for better price offers, cancelling their subscription because of poor customer service, or discontinuing all contact with a brand due to insufficient touchpoints.\n","Syriatel is a provider of mobile telecommunication and data services based in Damascus, Syria. The company offers services including calls, news, message, GSM and internet services. It has successfully established its reputation by focusing on customer satisfaction and social responsibility. Syriatel has established that long-term relationships with customers are more effective than trying to attract new customers. To them, working to keep a client is cheaper than working to get a new client. Churn prediction has therefore become a very important part of the company's strategy. This project aims to develop a model which accurately predicts customers who are most likely to churn, and identify the features that are important for predicting customer churn. Syriatel can thus act to prevent the customer who is likely to churn from actually churning."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## The Data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The dataset that I was given to work with contains information for 3333 accounts(columns), including:\n","- State\n","- Account Length\n","- Area Code\n","- Phone Number\n","- Extra Plans (VoiceMail and/or International)\n","- Minutes Used (Day, Evening, Night, International)\n","- Number of Calls (Day, Evening, Night, International)\n","- Number of VoiceMail Messages\n","- Total Amount Charged for minutes used (Day, Evening, Night, International)\n","- Number of calls to Customer Service\n","\n","and most importantly:\n","- Churn: Customers who cancelled their service."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Questions to Answer\n","1.

If it is tuned to be too sensitive in this area, that is fine. I would rather flag customers that aren't going to churn rather than focus on the customers that are likely to stay, and ending up with unexpected churn. I will keep this in balance by checking F1 Score.\n","\n","2. <b>Good F1 Score:</b>While I am ultimately not concerned with Precision (how well the model predicts customers that will stay), a good F1 score means that the model is performing well on both Recall and Precision. Since Recall and Precision are inverses of each other, a good F1 score ensures that the model isn't skewed too far toward one or the other. (ie, a model that predicts EVERY customer will churn would have perfect Recall, but would be useless).\n","\n","3. <b>High Cross Validation Score:</b> This ensures that the model isn't overly trained on the test data and that it does a good job of predicted unseen and unknown data. (ie, the test set).\n","\n","4. <b>Area Under the Curve (AUC):</b> The ROC AUC Score measures the Area under the ROC curve, which means that it classifies the true positive rate against the false positive rate. The higher the score, the better performing the model is. That said, here is the scale that I will use to evaluate my models:\n","- <u><b>.69 or less:</u></b> Model performs only slightly better than guessing and is worthless for my analysis.\n","- <u><b>.70 - .79:</u></b> Model still isn't performing very well, but is at minimum acceptable levels.\n","- <u><b>.80 - .89:</u></b> Model is performing fairly well. My goal is to be in this range or better.\n","- <u><b>.90 - .99:</u></b> Model is performing very well. I would be very happy to have a final model in this range."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Data Preparation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Importing
