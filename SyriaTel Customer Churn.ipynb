Customer churn is one of the most important concerns for large companies. Customer churn is a metric showing when a subscriber or a regular customer cancels his subscription or stops doing business with a company. Churn could be due to various factors, including switching to a competitor for better price offers, cancelling their subscription because of poor customer service, or discontinuing all contact with a brand due to insufficient touchpoints.\n","Syriatel is a provider of mobile telecommunication and data services based in Damascus, Syria. The company offers services including calls, news, message, GSM and internet services. It has successfully established its reputation by focusing on customer satisfaction and social responsibility. Syriatel has established that long-term relationships with customers are more effective than trying to attract new customers. To them, working to keep a client is cheaper than working to get a new client. Churn prediction has therefore become a very important part of the company's strategy. This project aims to develop a model which accurately predicts customers who are most likely to churn, and identify the features that are important for predicting customer churn. Syriatel can thus act to prevent the customer who is likely to churn from actually churning."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## The Data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The dataset that I was given to work with contains information for 3333 accounts(columns), including:\n","- State\n","- Account Length\n","- Area Code\n","- Phone Number\n","- Extra Plans (VoiceMail and/or International)\n","- Minutes Used (Day, Evening, Night, International)\n","- Number of Calls (Day, Evening, Night, International)\n","- Number of VoiceMail Messages\n","- Total Amount Charged for minutes used (Day, Evening, Night, International)\n","- Number of calls to Customer Service\n","\n","and most importantly:\n","- Churn: Customers who cancelled their service."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
